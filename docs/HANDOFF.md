# Handoff

Where the browser version stands, for a fresh session. Written 16 September 2026;
last updated late that night, after highlights, notes and the Display switches
went in.

## Read first

1. [`../README.md`](../README.md) — what this is, how to run it, which way work flows.
2. [`PORT-LOG.md`](PORT-LOG.md) — what each step cost and found.
3. [`PARITY.md`](PARITY.md) — every desktop feature, and which the browser has. **The to-do list.**
4. [`TESTING.md`](TESTING.md) — the checklist for what only a person can judge.
5. The plan, in the desktop repo: `../Mimick/docs/FUTURE-FEATURES.md`. The
   desktop handoff, `../Mimick/docs/HANDOFF.md`, has the traps that apply to
   the shared reading code.

## Decided

- **Piper voices only**, no Microsoft voices. **English only** for now.
- **Speed caps at 4×**, not the desktop's 5×.
- **Eight voices**, listed in `piper.RECOMMENDED` in the desktop repo. Ship
  their sample clips; fetch a model on first use and keep it in IndexedDB. Two
  of them hold many speakers (109 and 904); a picker for those comes after the
  reader works.
- **Laptop and desktop only.**
- **Work flows one way:** fix in `../Mimick`, then `tools/port.sh ../Mimick`.
  Never edit `py/` here.
- **Nothing from a CDN.** Everything is in `vendor/`.
- **No voice nicknames**, for now (17 September). Eight voices need no
  renaming, and Kat finds most voices beyond them mid at best.
- **Not a commercial venture.** Free, open source (AGPL-3.0), free to edit.
  The voice licences still have to be checked against that -- see **Next**.

## Where it stands

- **Step 1, the spike: done.** `node tools/check_spike.mjs` passes — the sample
  reads into the same 71 regions as the desktop app, in Node and in Chrome.
- **Step 2, Piper in a worker: done.** `voice.html`. 6.5× real time at 4
  threads, 3.5× on one, in Chrome on this 12-core machine; 4× reads with no
  stalls when threaded. `node tools/check_voice.mjs` passes. Details and
  findings in `PORT-LOG.md`.
- **Step 3, word timing: done.** Exact, from the model's own phoneme durations
  (`js/timing.js`). `node tools/check_timing.mjs` passes; `voice.html` now
  highlights each word of the passage as it is spoken.
- **Step 4a, the words on the page: done.** The desktop's `document.py` runs
  unchanged under Pyodide (`js/python.js`, `reading.py`), and so does
  `align_marks`, moved into it for the purpose. `node tools/check_reading.mjs`
  passes: 272 sentences and 8,395 words, identical to the desktop's to the
  rectangle, both with the cleanup on and off.
- **Step 4b, the pages: done.** `reader.html`: open a PDF (button, Ctrl+O, drop
  it on the page), scroll, turn pages, zoom 40–400%, in the
  desktop's colours and bar layout. Pyodide runs in `js/document-worker.js`;
  pages are drawn only while on screen or next to it (`js/page-layout.js`).
  `node tools/check_reader.mjs` passes. **Kat has
  tested it by hand** (`TESTING.md`): everything on the list works.
- **Step 4c, reading on the page: done.** One voice, `en_US-lessac-low`;
  speed 0.75–4×, changed at once; the sentence and word lit; the place in each
  document remembered. Scans are drawn ahead by page workers and kept.
- **Step 5 is under way: the desktop's features, one group at a time**, from
  `PARITY.md`. Done: right-click, selecting and the text cursor, highlights and
  notes (panel, movable strip, undo, kept in the browser, Download a copy), the
  Display switches, and Help. Not done: see **Next**.
- **PyMuPDF is pinned to 1.28.2**, matching the desktop. Bump both repos together.
- **Local only.** No remote. The public GitHub repo is Kat's call.
- **`sample readings/` is Kat's own documents**, git-ignored because they are
  not ours to redistribute, and **to be deleted before this goes anywhere near
  public**. Use them for testing until then: a 598-page scanned book
  (*Constructing meaning*) and a 212-page curriculum.

## How the page fits together

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `reader.html` | The layout, styles, dialogs. Dark only, in the desktop's colours. |
| `js/reader.js` | Opening, pages, zoom, the reading controls, selecting and the cursor, the right-click and Display menus, every key. |
| `js/read-aloud.js` | The player: prefetch, Web Audio, speed, which word is lit. No DOM. |
| `js/notes.js` | Highlights on the page, the notes panel, note editor, undo, the movable strip, the Notes menu. |
| `js/notes-store.js`, `js/page-store.js` | IndexedDB: notes (never evicted), drawn scan pages (evicted). |
| `js/document-worker.js` + `reader.py` | Pyodide with the desktop's `document.py` and `annotations.py`: sentences, words, the cursor's steps, highlights. The page asks through one generic `call` message for most of it. |
| `js/page-worker.js` + `pages.py` | Drawing pages, without annotations. |
| `js/piper-worker.js`, `piper-core.js`, `timing.js` | The voice. |
| `serve.py` | The test server. Use it, not `http.server` -- trap 10. |
| `tools/cdp.mjs` | Headless Chrome with real input, shared by the three page checks. |

## Running it

```bash
python3 serve.py                     # then http://localhost:8731/reader.html
node tools/check_spike.mjs
node tools/check_voice.mjs           # these two need en_US-lessac-low from the desktop app
node tools/check_timing.mjs
node tools/check_reading.mjs
node tools/check_reader.mjs
node tools/check_selecting.mjs       # needs serve.py running; starts its own headless Chrome
node tools/check_notes.mjs           # the same
node tools/check_display.mjs         # the same
node tools/check_order.mjs           # the same
node tools/check_convert.mjs         # the same; downloads a voice on its first run
```

**A headless Chrome, driven from Node, is the easiest way to test the page**,
and works when the Claude in Chrome extension is not connected. Start
`google-chrome --headless=new --remote-debugging-port=9333
--user-data-dir=<scratch folder>`, open a tab through
`http://localhost:9333/json/new?<url>` (a PUT), and talk to its
`webSocketDebuggerUrl` with Node's own `WebSocket`: `DOM.setFileInputFiles` on
`#file` opens a PDF, `Input.dispatchKeyEvent` and `Input.dispatchMouseEvent`
give real keys and clicks, `Runtime.evaluate` reads the state back. That is
how the Page Up bug below was found. Stop it by process ID -- `pkill -f` with
the port in the pattern also matches, and kills, the shell running it.

Claude in Chrome drives these pages: click by screen position, not by element
reference. A reading at 1× outlasts the 45-second limit on one script call, so
start it and read the log afterwards -- and never start a second driver script
on a page where one may still be running; they stop each other's playback.

**The tab Claude drives counts as hidden.** No animation frames, no scroll
events from a script, and after a few minutes timers fire about once a minute,
so a scripted test of the reader crawls or stalls. Test it with real input
instead -- the scroll, click and key actions, then a screenshot, which makes the
page draw -- or ask Kat to bring the tab to the front.

## Traps so far

1. **`<audio>` never starts in a tab that has not been in front.** Play through
   Web Audio. See `PORT-LOG.md`.
2. **Speed-up is ours.** Web Audio raises pitch with rate; `stretch` in
   `js/piper-core.js` keeps it, and keeps length exactly input / rate.
3. **The browser's espeak-ng pronounces some numbers slightly differently.**
   `KNOWN_DRIFT` in `tools/check_voice.mjs`; do not add to it without listening.
4. **A word's mark comes before its sound, by up to about 125 ms.** Correct:
   stops and breathy consonants start quiet. Do not "fix" marks to loudness.
5. **No animation frames in a hidden tab.** Anything that follows playback
   must also work from a timer.
6. **The phonemizer leaks its stack on every call** and dies after a few
   dozen. `createPhonemizer` replaces it before then; call it through that,
   never `callMain` directly.
7. **One voice session runs one sentence at a time.** The worker queues its
   messages; overlapping runs crash ONNX Runtime on threads, and only when the
   timing lines up.
8. **Make the `AudioContext` in the click or key press.** `read-aloud.js`'s
   `prepare()` is called there for that reason; one made after waiting on a
   worker may never make a sound.
9. **Every message to a worker with an id must be answered**, errors included.
   The page waits on each; one that is never answered stops everything queued
   behind it without a word.
10. **`python3 -m http.server` lets Chrome keep old scripts.** It sends no
    caching headers, so Chrome guesses, and ran last hour's `read-aloud.js`
    after an edit -- `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`R` does not help, because
    `coi-serviceworker.js` reloads the page once more. Use `serve.py`. When a
    change seems to do nothing, check the script actually loaded first.
11. **Clear Chrome's cache in a headless test** (`Network.clearBrowserCache`),
    and remember `localStorage` survives between runs: a saved speed or
    reading position changes what the next run does.

## Next

**Kat to test first:** the three newest sections at the top of `TESTING.md`
-- *Display switches, and Help*, *Highlights and notes*, *Speed, right-click,
selecting and the cursor*. Nothing in them has been used by hand yet; every
one is covered by a Chrome check, which says it works, not that it feels right.
She may leave notes in `docs/TESTING DONE.txt` (untracked, hers -- do not commit
it); read it at the start of a session.

**What happened on 16 September, in order** (`git log` has the rest):

1. Speed changed only from the next sentence, and Kat's Chrome was running old
   scripts anyway (trap 10). Speed now applies mid-sentence; `serve.py` added.
2. Right-click menu, selecting, the text cursor.
3. Highlights and notes. Decisions: notes are kept in IndexedDB as plain data
   (`reader.snapshot` / `restore`), not as a PDF -- a scanned book would be
   ~100 MB a save; the PDF is only made for Download a copy. Pages are drawn
   without annotations and the page draws highlights live. The browser has no
   menu bar, so **Notes ▾ / Display ▾ / Help ▾** in the header stand in.
4. Display switches (`reader.set_reading` holds the place by word) and Help.
   A pause in the first 60 ms of reading used to be undone; fixed.

**17 September.** Two fixes from testing: keys pressed in the ~60 ms before
the note editor opens no longer reach the page (an Enter there started
reading), and `Esc` on a new note no longer leaves a stale status line. Then
**Show reading order**: `reader.py`'s `regions`, `toggle_region`,
`set_region_choices` and `reset_regions`; the `order` block in `reader.js`.
Choices are kept in `localStorage` as `mimick-order:<document key>`, by the
desktop's region key, and put back after open and after the cleanup is
switched (which analyses the pages again). Unlike the desktop, the overlay
shows a footnote as read when **Read footnotes** is on -- it asks
`Document._region_reads`, where the desktop's `page_view` asks `region.reads`.
Putting corrections back rebuilds the sentences a second time, which on the
598-page book costs as much again as opening; passing them in at open would
need `Document` to take them, in the desktop repo.

**Later on 17 September: the voice picker.** The eight voices, their hashes
and the pinned revision are in `js/voices.js`, which the page and
`piper-worker.js` both load. Hashes came from the Hugging Face API's LFS
`oid` for each `.onnx` (it reproduces lessac's exactly) and from hashing each
`.onnx.json`. Sample clips ship in `voices/`, with their licences -- **Lessac
and Kusal need checking before going public.** `MimickReadAloud.setVoice`
drops the voice worker and carries on from the sentence playing. The voice box
sits in the right of the top bar; the title now gives way when the bar is
short of room, and the labels hide below 1150px -- the first try put the box
on the left and pushed the bar under **Read aloud**, so ▶ started reading.

**Later still, 17 September: Convert to MP3** (`js/convert.js`, `js/mp3-worker.js`,
`reader.convert_texts`). A voice worker of its own makes each sentence and
`vendor/lamejs` (LGPL, credited in About as LAME asks) encodes it as it comes.
In Chrome `showSaveFilePicker` is asked for inside the Convert click -- it must
be, or the browser refuses -- and the file is written a sentence at a time;
cancelled or failed, the writable is aborted, so nothing half-made is left.
Elsewhere, and in the headless check, it downloads at the end. **Open…**
became **File ▾** to make room without widening the top bar. Estimates use the
desktop's 15.1 characters a second; converting is guessed at 4× real time,
which ran about 12× here, so the first estimate is long until the job times
itself.

**Reading time**, asked for by Kat: the bottom bar's left corner shows how
long the document takes at the speed in the top bar's **Speed** box, and
nothing else, changing whenever that box does; while reading, what is left at
it. From `reader.sentence_lengths` and the desktop's 15.1 characters a second.
Against a real conversion of the sample's page 1 it ran about 15% long for
Lessac. **The desktop app has no such estimate** -- it is on the list in
`PARITY.md`, **For the desktop**.

**Known:** on a page printed sideways the highlight runs across the lines
instead of along them. It comes from the shared reading code, so fix it in the
desktop repo if at all.

**Next, in order.**

0. **First: the voice licences.** Search out the terms of use for each of the
   eight voices in `js/voices.js` and say plainly whether Mimick may use them
   as it does. Mimick is free, open source and not commercial -- but AGPL lets
   anyone reuse it, commercially included, so note where a licence turns on
   that. Three uses to check separately: **fetching** each model from
   `rhasspy/piper-voices` at run time; **shipping** each sample clip in
   `voices/`; and **people's MP3s** made with a voice. For each voice, read the
   model card and follow it to the dataset's own licence. Known so far
   (`voices/README.md`): Kathleen and Joe CC0, Norman public domain, Southern
   English CC BY-SA 4.0, VCTK and LibriTTS CC BY 4.0. **Lessac** points at the
   Blizzard 2013 Lessac licence (CSTR, Edinburgh), whose terms have to be read;
   **Kusal**'s card says only "See URL", MycroftAI/mimic2. Also check the
   `piper-voices` repository's own licence, and whether CC BY and BY-SA need an
   attribution in the page (About is the obvious place). Write the findings
   into `voices/README.md`; if a voice cannot be used, say so to Kat before
   removing it. The desktop app offers every Piper voice from the catalogue,
   so note anything that matters there too.

Then the rest of `PARITY.md`:

1. ~~Show reading order~~ -- done 17 September; see below.
2. **Read aloud while a long document is still opening.** Read aloud is greyed
   out until every sentence is built -- 45s for the 598-page book. `Document`
   builds them all in its constructor, in the desktop's shared `document.py`,
   so reading early means building page by page (change it there, then port).
   Word indices must stay what a full build gives (desktop trap 9) -- and
   highlights are now keyed to them too.
3. ~~The voice picker~~ -- done 17 September. Nicknames: not wanted for now.
4. **Keep scroll and zoom per document across a reload**, and **Forget this
   document** (notes, drawn pages, position).
5. ~~Convert to MP3~~ -- done 17 September, bar two small things in `PARITY.md`. Then **Open Recent** (Chrome can keep file handles), which goes in **File ▾**.

The layout follows the desktop app, Photopea-style; the shortcuts are shared
(`FUTURE-FEATURES.md`, **Shortcuts**).

**State to leave tidy:** `serve.py` may still be running on 8731 from the last
session (started in the background); it is harmless, and restarting it is
`python3 serve.py`. Nothing is pushed anywhere -- this repo has no remote.
