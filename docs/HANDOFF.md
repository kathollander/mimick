# Handoff

Everything a fresh session needs to pick Mimick up. Written 11 September 2026,
the evening the project was built; updated 12 September, the evening it was
published.

## What Mimick is

A PDF reader that reads aloud in natural voices, highlighting each word as it
speaks it. It exists because Linux had no equivalent of Edge's Read Aloud; it
runs on Windows as well as of v0.2.0. Written by Claude Code, arranged by Kat Hollander
([github.com/kathollander](https://github.com/kathollander)). AGPL-3.0, because
MuPDF is.

Read [`../README.md`](../README.md) first — it is the user-facing description
and is kept accurate. Then [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for what is planned and
the traps in this codebase.

## Running it

```bash
./install.sh                 # venv + deps + desktop entry; safe to re-run
.venv/bin/python -m mimick "Testing/Big Ideas from Atleo and Boron 2022.pdf"
```

That second line only works **from the project folder** -- see trap 10. To
exercise what a user actually gets, run the installed launcher from somewhere
else:

```bash
cd ~ && ~/.local/bin/mimick
```

**Always set `MIMICK_CONFIG_DIR` when testing**, or the test overwrites the
settings actually in use:

```bash
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen MIMICK_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/mimick-test \
    .venv/bin/python tools/check_shortcuts.py
.venv/bin/python tools/check_reading.py Testing/
```

## How it fits together

| File | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `mimick/system.py` | Every platform difference: folder locations, ffmpeg, console-window suppression. |
| `mimick/document.py` | PDF → words → sentences. Word order, hyphen rejoining, run breaking. |
| `mimick/layout.py` | Recursive XY-cut. Decides which regions are body, aside or furniture. |
| `mimick/citations.py` | Regexes for in-text citations, so `[51]` is not read aloud. |
| `mimick/speech.py` | Cleanup before the voice: ligatures, stranded accents, masthead and declarations. |
| `mimick/player.py` | Playback: prefetch queue, transport, word-timing alignment. |
| `mimick/engines/` | `edge.py` (online, word timings), `piper.py` (offline), `kokoro.py`. |
| `mimick/export.py` | MP3 conversion; streams PCM to a temp file, two workers. |
| `mimick/annotations.py` | Highlights and notes as real PDF annotations. |
| `mimick/ui/page_view.py` | The canvas: its own scroll area, page cache, notes panel, plan overlay. |
| `mimick/ui/main_window.py` | Everything else. The big one. |
| `tools/` | `check_shortcuts.py`, `check_reading.py`. Run both after changes. |

**The reading pipeline**, in order: `layout.analyse` cuts each page into regions
and labels them, then marks the reference list and everything after it →
`Document._build_sentences` walks regions in reading order, taking words from
readable ones and passing each through `speech.normalise` → runs break at region
boundaries (except a paragraph carrying to the next page) → a run that is
labelled boilerplate is dropped whole → `chunk_into_sentences` splits on
punctuation and drops runs that are not language → `citations.mark_words` plus a
strip of the assembled text removes in-text citations.

**There is one text pipeline, not two.** Live reading and MP3 conversion both
consume `Document.sentences`; the export dialog filters that list by page range,
and, when its cleanup checkbox disagrees with the open document, takes the list
from a second `Document` opened the other way and closed again by
`ExportDialog.release()` (a `Sentence` holds only strings and rectangles, so it
outlives the PDF it came from). Anything done to the spoken text therefore has to be done in
`document.py` or below, never in `export.py`, or the two paths drift. The
`clean_text` setting (**Display → Clean up text for reading**) and
`skip_citations` both gate behaviour inside `Document` for exactly that reason.
Reading a *selection* goes through `Document.sentences_from_range`, which is
easy to forget — it silently ignored citation skipping until it was fixed.

## Traps that cost real time tonight

**1. PySide6 delivers worker signals on the worker thread.** A plain function, a
bound method, and a `@Slot`-decorated method with `Qt.QueuedConnection` all ran
inside the worker. Calling `QThread.wait()` from such a handler deadlocks
outright — the app froze mid-conversion. The export uses
`QCoreApplication.postEvent` with a custom `ExportEvent`, which Qt *does*
guarantee lands in the receiving object's thread. **Reuse that pattern for any
new worker.**

**2. `QDialog.close()` routes through `reject()`.** `ExportProgressDialog`
overrode `reject()` to mean *cancel*, so closing it on completion only asked it
to stop and left it on screen saying "Stopping…". Every exit now goes through
`finish()`, which sets a flag first.

**3. String literals are inconsistent about escapes.** Some hold `…`
literally, others the character `…`. Pattern-matching on those fails *silently*
— three separate edits tonight appeared to succeed and did nothing, once
leaving a method with a line deleted and its replacement never written.
**Read the actual bytes first, assert that the pattern matched, and prefer
line-anchored edits.**

**4. Do not size a widget to the whole document.** Sixty pages is ~64,000px,
past where Qt coordinates behave. `PageView` is a `QAbstractScrollArea` that
paints only the visible band.

**5. `_ends_sentence` must strip punctuation from both ends.** It only stripped
trailing punctuation, so `"(p."` did not match the abbreviation `p` and the
splitter cut `(p. 21)` in half — 45 times in a 12-page paper. The voice said
"pee" and the page number was lost. Relatedly, `citations.mark_words` matches a
word that *begins* inside a citation rather than one wholly contained by it,
because `"21)."` reaches a character past the closing bracket.

**6. A dead playback thread is silent, not loud.** `align_marks` used `spoken`
as both the list of words and the loop variable over `clip.marks`, so
`spoken[offset][1]` indexed a single character and raised `IndexError` on the
first word of the first sentence. That killed the `mimick-play` thread before a
sample reached the speakers: no sound, no dialog, no clue. `Player._run`
swallows nothing, but nothing watches the thread either. **When playback does
nothing, drive `Player` directly from a script** — the traceback prints there,
where it never reaches the interface.

**7. `Player.configure` must clamp the playhead.** It replaces the sentence list
without touching `_index`, and a rebuild can shrink that list by a quarter.
`_run`'s `while self._index < len(self._sentences)` then exits at once — silent
again. It now clamps; callers that rebuild should still hold the reader's place
by *word* index, as `_toggle_clean_text` does, because sentence numbers mean
nothing across a rebuild.

**8. `VoiceLoader` is deleted out from under its own attribute.**
`loader.finished.connect(loader.deleteLater)` leaves `self._voice_loader`
pointing at a wrapper whose C++ object is gone, and any call on it raises
`RuntimeError: Internal C++ object already deleted`. The reference is cleared on
`finished` now, and `closeEvent` guards anyway.

**9. Word indices must stay stable.** Annotations store `first_word`/`last_word`.
Word order comes from region order, which does not change when a region is
included or excluded — that is why `set_region_reads` can rebuild safely. The
same rule is why `speech.normalise` may rewrite a word but must never drop one:
`clean_text` would otherwise shift every index after the first word it removed,
and the export dialog could not reuse a selection made against the open
document. Both builds give 8,395 words with identical rectangles.

**10. The applications-menu launcher is not the terminal launcher.**
`python -m mimick` resolves the package through the *working directory*. In a
terminal that is the project folder, so it works; from the menu it is `$HOME`,
so it died instantly with `No module named mimick` and no window -- the app
simply did not open. The package is not installed into the venv (there is no
`pyproject.toml`), so `install.sh` writes a launcher that sets `PYTHONPATH`.
Setting the path rather than `cd`-ing keeps a relative filename argument
resolving against wherever the user actually is. **Test the installed launcher
from `$HOME`, not from the project folder** -- from the project folder the bug
is invisible.

## Windows

Added on 12 September 2026 and **not yet run on a real Windows machine** — it
was written and reasoned through on Linux. Treat every claim below as designed
rather than observed.

`mimick/system.py` holds every platform difference; nothing else in the
codebase should learn what operating system it is on. Three things differ:

- **Folders.** `%APPDATA%\Mimick` for settings, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mimick\Cache`
  for voices — 60 MB downloads have no business in a roaming profile.
- **ffmpeg.** No system copy exists, so `install.ps1` downloads a static build
  into the cache folder and `ffmpeg_command()` looks there as well as on `PATH`.
- **Console windows.** Windows opens one for every child process of a windowed
  app. `decode_audio` runs *once per sentence* during playback, so every ffmpeg
  call passes `no_window_kwargs()` or a black box blinks on screen throughout
  the reading. **Any new subprocess must pass it too.**

**`install.ps1` avoids trap 10 differently from `install.sh`.** Instead of a
`PYTHONPATH` shim it writes a `.pth` file into the venv's site-packages naming
the project folder, which makes `python -m mimick` resolve from any working
directory. That is strictly better — it covers the Start Menu shortcut, the
terminal command and the "Open with" entry at once, with no wrapper — and
`install.sh` should probably adopt it, but the Linux launcher is tested and was
left alone. See the roadmap.

Two Windows traps worth knowing before debugging an install:

- **The Microsoft Store Python is a trap.** A zero-byte `python.exe` sits on
  `PATH` and opens the Store instead of running. The installer tries the `py`
  launcher first and ignores anything under `WindowsApps` for this reason.
- **`pythonw.exe`, not `python.exe`,** for the shortcut and the file
  association, or a console window sits behind Mimick the whole time it is open.

The dependencies are the one part that is not guesswork. Every requirement
resolves to a Windows binary wheel, with no compiler needed, on Python 3.10
through 3.14; 3.15 has no PySide6 yet. `piper-tts` 1.8 bundles `espeakbridge`
and its espeak-ng data inside the wheel, so offline voices need nothing from
the system. To re-check after a dependency bump:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pip install --dry-run --ignore-installed \
    --only-binary=:all: --platform win_amd64 --python-version 3.13 \
    --target /tmp/x -r requirements.txt
```

What is genuinely untested: the PowerShell itself beyond parsing and
PSScriptAnalyzer, the ffmpeg download, the Start Menu shortcut, the registry
entries, `asyncio.run` per sentence on a Proactor event loop in the Edge
engine, and **audio latency**. That last one is the real risk — word-sync
highlighting assumes the playhead matches what is audible, and if WASAPI buffers
more deeply than ALSA the highlight will lag the voice. Only an ear can tell.

## State on disk

Paths below are Linux; on Windows `~/.config/mimick` is `%APPDATA%\Mimick` and
`~/.cache/mimick` is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Mimick\Cache`. `MIMICK_CONFIG_DIR` and
`MIMICK_CACHE_DIR` override both on either platform.

- `~/.config/mimick/settings.json` — voice, speed, zoom, reading positions,
  per-document reading-order corrections, preview phrases.
- `~/.cache/mimick/piper/` — downloaded voices (~60 MB each).
- `~/.cache/mimick/piper-samples/` — preview clips (~90 KB each).
- `~/.cache/mimick/ffmpeg/` — Windows only; the copy `install.ps1` downloads.

## Where it stands

Working and tested: reading with online and offline voices, word-sync
highlighting, speed to 3×, selection reading, highlights and margin notes saved
as PDF annotations, MP3 conversion with estimates and working cancellation,
layout analysis with a visible editable reading order, citation skipping, and
the reading cleanup — reference lists, masthead and declarations left out,
ligatures and stranded accents repaired — switchable in **Display** and
overridable for a single conversion in the Convert to MP3 window.

Fixed on the 12th, all found by using the app rather than by reading it: read
aloud produced no sound at all (trap 6), the applications-menu entry did not
start (trap 10), citations split across a sentence boundary were half-spoken
(trap 5), and the reference list was read out in full.

Also on the 12th, **v0.2.0 added Windows** — see the Windows section above. It
is written but unverified on the platform it targets, which makes it the single
biggest untested surface in the project.

Not done: see [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md). The release checklist there is the
next thing to work through. The two most valuable tasks are **trying it on more
real documents** — `tools/check_reading.py` makes that quick — and **testing
the installer on a machine that is not this one**, which is the only part of
the install path still unverified.

pushed on 12 September 2026. Commit as `kathollander <kathoacct@pm.me>`, which
is what the initial LICENSE commit used.

`Testing/*.mp3` is git-ignored: conversions run to 26 MB and regenerate in
seconds. The sample PDF is kept — it is MDPI, CC BY 4.0, and the docs and both
check tools point at it.
